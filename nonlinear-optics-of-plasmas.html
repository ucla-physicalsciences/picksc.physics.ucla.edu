            <h5>The nonlinear optics of plasmas and inertial confinement fusion</h5>
            <p>PICKSC members and its collaborators are engaged in research to significantly advance the fundamental 
            understanding of the nonlinear optics of plasmas and electron transport in high-energy-density laboratory 
            plasmas (HEDLP), including conditions of relevance to Inertial Fusion Energy and the National Ignition 
            Facility. In inertial fusion energy the pressure produced by lasers interacting with plasmas must ultimately 
            compress a pellet of Deuterium and Tritium to high pressures and densities to initiate fusion reactions. 
            When the laser propagates in high energy density plasmas it can be deflected, reflected, and absorbed by 
            and into waves which exist inside the plasma due to fundamental processes within the nonlinear optics of 
            plasmas. These processes can lead to asymmetries in the pressure preventing the pellet to compress 
            properly. The plasma waves can then be converted into heat or into very energetic electrons. The heat 
            and energetic electrons can modify the laser propagation and also make it difficult to compress the 
            target, or in some cases help to compress the target. Understanding how lasers propagate through 
            plasmas at pressures above a 1 million atmospheres and how electrons and heat propagate in plasmas 
            with densities as high 1000 times solid density is therefore rich in fundamental science as well 
            as of practical importance to inertial fusion science. The processes are so complicated that in 
            order to truly understand them, it is necessary that computer simulations be used that follow the 
            trajectories of individual particles or follow the fine details of the distribution function of the 
            electrons in energy and in location. We use state-of-the art PIC and Vlasov Fokker Planck codes to 
            study laser plasmas interactions and non-local electron transport.</p>
