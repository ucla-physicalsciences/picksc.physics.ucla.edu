            <p>The UCLA Simulation of Plasmas Group was formed in 1973 by the late John M. Dawson. Under his leadership the 
            group developed a suite of FFT based (spectral) PIC codes 
            [<a href="http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.55.403">Reviews of Modern Physics Article</a>]. 
            The group used these codes to study problems involving basic and applied plasma physics in magnetically confined plasmas, 
            space plasmas, radiation sources, intense short laser and beam plasma interactions, and in plasma based 
            acceleration. The group invented the laser wakefield and plasma wakefield accelerator concepts and pioneered 
            using parallel computing for PIC codes, including the first paper on domain decomposition for PIC codes. It 
            also invented the subtraction technique to identify wakes made by single particles from thermal fluctuations.</p>
            <p>The group has been led by Warren B. Mori (the Director of PICKSC) since 1998 and since then has been a leader 
            in the use of parallel PIC codes in plasma-based acceleration, in laser plasma interactions of interest to inertial 
            fusion energy, and in relativistic shocks. The group pioneered the development and use of parallel PIC simulations 
            for short pulse laser and beam plasma interactions, for the moving window technique for plasma based acceleration, 
            for three dimensional quasi-static PIC techniques, and for the use of ponderomotive guiding center techniques in 
            PIC codes.  It was a leader in the development of Lorentz boosted frame techniques and has recently been at the 
            forefront in eliminating the numerical Cerenkov instability. Together with its collaborators, it has been a 
            leader in the development of the nonlinear blowout regime for plasma based acceleration, including beam loading,  
            as well as the development of novel self-injection techniques into plasma wakefields. It has been at the forefront 
            of using the synergy between full-scale modeling and experiments to unravel ultra-fast and intense laser and beam 
            plasma interactions.  The group has also been at the forefront in developing generalizable algorithms for PIC to 
            run on many core platforms such as GPUs.</p>
            <p>The research efforts of the group remain in high performance computing, in plasma based acceleration and light 
            sources, and in the nonlinear optics of plasmas in high energy density plasmas, including research into high 
            intensity and relativistic laser and beam plasma interactions, inertial fusion energy, and relativistic shocks.</p>
            <p>PICKSC was formed to allow the home-grown PIC and kinetic simulation software of the UCLA Plasma Simulation 
            Group to have a broader impact.</p>
            <p>Below, we highlight recent research activities of the group including research on new algorithms and simulation techniques.</p>

              <p><b>Developing sustainable and re-useable PIC and other kinetic software for high performance computing</b>. PICKSC 
              members and its collaborators are researching software engineering issues for how to modularize a PIC Framework and 
              PIC production codes, on isolating PIC software that needs to be modified for next generation hardware with many 
              layers of memory and parallelism, on striking the best balance between a general Framework and production codes, 
              on developing new physics packages and the ability of models to work together, on documenting software, on 
              benchmarking and comparison activities of the models and solvers that are supported, on developing examples of 
              best practices, on educational software for undergraduate and graduate courses in plasma physics and computer 
              science, and on maintaining a set of stable production codes for general use.  <a href="high-performance-computing.html">Read more</a>.</p>
