            <p>
              The UCLA Particle-in-Cell (PIC) and Kinetic Simulation Software Center (PICKSC) uses and develops simulation and data science tools to make fundamental discoveries in plasma based acceleration, plasma based light sources, plasma astrophysics, intense laser and plasma interactions, the nonlinear optics of plasmas, and high fidelity simulation.  The Center is also committed to making its software available to others to accelerate the rate of scientific discovery and to provide unique educational tools. We are users and developers of OSIRIS, UPIC, QuickPIC, and QPAD and a set of Jupyter notebooks aimed at education. If you like more information on this software please look at the software page.
            </p>

              PICKSC is housed within the UCLA Departments of Physics and Astronomy and of Electrical and Computer Engineering. It is co-led by Professors W.B. Mori and E. Paulo Alves.
            <p>
              We are closely connected with the UCLA Laser-Plasma Group led by Professor C. Joshi.

                  "Arbitrarily structured laser pulses" published in Physical Review Research</b>: 
                  A new mathematical formalism for describing laser fields with complex spatial and temporal 
                  structure has just been published in Physical Review Research.
                  This work was lead by PICKSC team member Jacob Pierce. 
                  This new theoretical formalism offers a powerful tool for exploring how spatially and temporally 
                  structured laser pulses interact with plasmas, and how such pulses might be leveraged to enhance various 
                  laser-based applications, including laser wakefield acceleration, inertial confinement fusion, 
                  nanophotonics, and attosecond physics.

              <!-- <p><b>KNL Timings</b>: PICKSC researchers have been updating our software to take full advantage of the many-core Intel 
              Knightâ€™s Landing (KNL) nodes. An OpenMP 3D electrostatic code from UPIC 2.0 has achieved a performance of 
              850 psec/particle-step on a single Intel KNL node. On a large memory KNL such as the 96 GB node on the Cori 
              machine at NERSC, a PIC simulation with a billion particles will run in about one second per time step. A new 
              branch of QuickPIC has also been compiled and run on Cori at NERSC. On a single KNL node with 68 threads, the 
              total time spent on one particle per step is 3.82 ns (including 1 iteration).</p>
              <p><b>Fortran OpenPMD File Writers</b>: We have written an open source program that contains Fortran interfaces 
              for parallel writing of 2D/3D mesh field data and particle data into HDF5 files using the OpenPMD standard. The 
              software is open source and available on our GitHub repositories here.</p> -->
